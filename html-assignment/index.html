  <p>hello sir <sup>CD</sup></p>

  <p>
    Hi, my name is <strong>Saskar Baniya.</strong> I am students of Algonquin
    College and my program is Interactive Media design <br />I choose this
    course because i am more interested in designing fields and also it is my
    hobby, not only my hobby <br />
    it's my passion too. I like to do design because it makes me happy. <br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Canada is one of the best country for international students,</em> so
    that's why i had choose to study in Canada. It is one <br />of the safest
    country as well, and lots of opportunity is here rather than my country. I
    hope after completing this <br />course i will be in a professional field.
  </p>
